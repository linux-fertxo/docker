### Repository structure:

* Each service has its own folder and `README.md`. Check out each one to better understand how they work.
* They can be run from CLI or be imported to Portainer, Dockge...
* Although they can be deployed at any time, it's interesting to follow this order to fulfill dependencies:

      1. Socket Proxy
      3. Traefik 
      4. Authelia
      5. Nextcloud
      6. Crowdsec
      7. Any other container with Traefik labels

### What can I learn here?

All services are fully functional, but I am aware that there are different (infinite) ways to approach each one. Although all of them could be improved, I tried that each one have at least one new technique that we can apply in other contexts.

* In Socket Proxy we will see the **general structure of a docker-compose**:
  * Services, networks, volumes and environment variables.
  * The inclusion of `privileged` to create containers with elevated privileges on the host machine.
* In Traefik we will see the **use of labels** and also:
  * The correlation between files within the container and their mount points on the host machine's file system.
  * Create networks external to the compose.
  * Create Tokens on Cloudflare.
* In Authelia we will introduce the **use of secrets** as a security measure for our sensitive data.
  * We will also learn how to generate strong passwords on a Linux system.
  * We will see how to run commands within a container that has not yet been started.
* In Nextcloud we will see a **multi-service compose**:
  * One container for the application, another one for the relational database and another one for the in-memory database.
  * The use of `command` as a mean of launching a container always with the same initial conditions.
* In Crowdsec how to **run commands in a container**:
  * From outside in our shell and from inside with interactive mode.
  * We will also look at the use of _plugins_ in Traefik.
* In OPNdash how to create **preset volumes** in Docker.
* In Proxmox Backup Server how to **create a preset volume** but have the container see it **as a physical storage device**.
* And other things I'll think about along the way...
